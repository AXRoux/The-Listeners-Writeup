  ## Initial Assesment
  Upon viewing the image there are key indicators that stood out to me that I used to pinpoint a general location. 
  
  **Image 1:** 
  
  ![Mirror](https://github.com/VEEXH/The-Listeners-Writeup/blob/main/S1.jpg "TM-F French Premium traffic mirror")
  
  The TM-F French Premium traffic mirror corresponds to the specific characteristics of french traffic regulations, conform to the French act of 1981. The mirror helps to increase the safety on roads. Google lens identified the mirror as a traffic mirror and I was able to use this website **http://www.vsi.eu/en/traffic-mirrors** to accurately pinpoint which country uses this specific black and white pattern. 
  
  **Image 2:**

  This image consits of two plants:
  
  Agapanthus praecox (common agapanthus, blue lily, African lily, or lily of the Nile) is a popular garden plant around the world, especially in Mediterranean climates and Salvia rosmarinus, commonly known as rosemary, is a shrub with fragment, evergreen, needle like leaves and white, pink purple, or blue flowers, native to the Mediterranean region. Google lens is capable of identfying plants however, if you want a more accurate analysis use can use **plant.id** a free plant identification service based on machine learning.

## Region that fits the description

In the mission briefing there are keywords that standout which allow for making an accurate analysis of which part of the world the meeting place is taking in. The mission briefing states that the rivals enjoy a luxurious lifestyle **"along the coastlines of Western and Southern Europe."** There is only one place that fits the description along the Frensh speaking  Mediterranean coastline and that is the French Riviera. The French Riviera is a place that has always catered to the elite, giving them access to luxury property, lifestyle of cars, yachts and seafront property.

## Analyzing Architecture 

The French Riviera spans a massive coastline and checking every general location would take too much so to shorten the amount of time it would take in identifying a precise area of where the meeting is going to take place I began cross-referencing the architecture styles of the most famous areas of the French Riviera. 

### French Art Nouveau architecture - Cannes, France

A majority of the architecture within the city of Cannes has an art nouveau style which is an art movement that emerged in France in the late 19th century. The style is characterized by its use of curved lines and organic forms, as well as its focus on nature and the natural world. The architecture of villas in the photo of the meeting place is more opulent and luxurious than their Cannes counterparts. 

## Traditional Provençal architecture - Saint Tropez, France

Saint Tropez is a town in southeastern France that is famous for its chic beaches and celebrity residents. The town has a long history, dating back to the Roman era. Its traditional architecture is a reflection of this rich history. The most notable feature of Saint Tropez's traditional architecture is its use of bright colours. The buildings are often painted in shades of pink, yellow, and blue. This is in contrast to the more muted colours commonly seen in other parts of France.
Another distinctive feature of Saint Tropez's architecture is its use of geometric shapes. The buildings are often designed with simple, clean lines. This gives the town a modern feel, despite its traditional roots.

## Art Deco Architecture - Monaco

Monaco villas are often more opulent and luxurious than their counterparts. This is due in part to the fact that Monaco is a sovereign city-state, and as such, its residents are some of the wealthiest in the world. Consequently, the architecture of Monaco villas tends to be more grandiose and ostentatious than that of Cannes and Saint-Tropez. Another key difference is that Monaco villas are often built on hilltops or cliffs, offering stunning views of the Mediterranean Sea. Lastly, due to the small size of Monaco, villas tend to be closer together than in Cannes, giving the city a more intimate feel.

## Searching Monaco - Destination of Meeting

I have decided that I am going to search Monaco as the defintion of it's architecture is the one that most resembles the picture provided during the mission brief. Upon searching Monaco it did not take long to find the meeting place although the meeting spot is completely different than the photo that was provided during the mission briefing. This is due to the area being edited with an optical illusion to increase the difficulty of the challenge.
