  ## Initial Assesment
  Upon viewing the image there are key indicators that stood out to me that I used to pinpoint a general location. 
  
  **Image 1:** 
  
  ![Mirror](https://github.com/VEEXH/The-Listeners-Writeup/blob/main/S1.jpg "TM-F French Premium traffic mirror")
  
  The TM-F French Premium traffic mirror corresponds to the specific characteristics of french traffic regulations, conform to the French act of 1981. The mirror helps to increase the safety on roads. Google lens identified the mirror as a traffic mirror and I was able to use this website **http://www.vsi.eu/en/traffic-mirrors** to accurately pinpoint which country uses this specific black and white pattern. 
  
  **Image 2:**
  
  ![Plant](https://github.com/VEEXH/The-Listeners-Writeup/blob/main/S2.jpg "Rosemary plant")
  
  This image consits of two plants:
  
  Agapanthus praecox (common agapanthus, blue lily, African lily, or lily of the Nile) is a popular garden plant around the world, especially in Mediterranean climates and Salvia rosmarinus, commonly known as rosemary, is a shrub with fragment, evergreen, needle like leaves and white, pink purple, or blue flowers, native to the Mediterranean region. Google lens is capable of identfying plants however, if you want a more accurate analysis use can use **plant.id** a free plant identification service based on machine learning.

## Area that fits the description

In the mission briefing there are keywords that standout which allow for making an accurate analysis of which part of the world the meeting place is taking in. The mission briefing states that the rivals enjoy a luxurious lifestyle **"along the coastlines of Western and Southern Europe."** There is only one place that fits the description along the Frensh speaking  Mediterranean coastline and that is the French Riviera. The French Riviera is a place that has always catered to the elite, giving them access to luxury property, lifestyle of cars, yachts and seafront property.

## Analyzing Architecture 

The French Riviera spans a massive coastline and checking every general location would take too much so to shorten the amount of time it would take in identifying a precise area of where the meeting is going to take place I began cross-referencing the architecture styles of the most famous areas of the French Riviera.
